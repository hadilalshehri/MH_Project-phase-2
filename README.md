Solving the optimization problem: Given a weighted graph G=(V,E) where V is a set of n nodes and E is a set of edges, let wi ≥ 0 be the weight of node i ∈ V and let cij ({i, j} ∈ E) be the edge weight between nodes i and j (cij =0, if {i, j} ∉ E). A clustering/grouping problem is to partition V into a given number p (p ≤ n) of disjoint clusters or groups such that the sum of node weights in each cluster is constrained by an upper and a lower capacity limit, while maximizing the sum of edge weights whose two associated endpoints belong to the same cluster.
